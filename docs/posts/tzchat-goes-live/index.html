now available for friendly users.  The services are still being configured and
tuned and so there may be rough edges, but tzchat.org accounts created now should
remain indefinitely.</p>
<p>One quirk is that the entry pages refer to &ldquo;tezos.modular.im&rdquo; rather that
&ldquo;tzchat.org&rdquo;. Our service is hosted by modular.im and tezos.modular.im is the actual
&ldquo;homeserver&rdquo; host for tzchat.org accounts. We are working to change the pages to hide
that internal name.</p>
<p>Any Matrix account created at tzchat.org is new and independent of any existing
Matrix account, those at matrix.org in particular. If you create a tzchat.org
account and login with it:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have to rejoin any rooms of interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you had special permissions (moderator, etc) on an old account you&rsquo;ll have login to
that old account and grant those permissions to your new account if you so wish.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to rejoin any private rooms (including &ldquo;People&rdquo; rooms, also known
as DMs) you&rsquo;ll have to invite your new account from your old one, or ask a room member
to do that for you.</p>
