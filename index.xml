      <description>Tezos rooms upgraded at Matrix/Riot As of May, 2020, several Tezos rooms at Matrix/Riot are being replaced with new versions (at the same addresses as before) that use the latest room protocol.
TL;DR: If you visit an old Tezos room and see a message about &amp;ldquo;This room has been replaced and is no longer active&amp;rdquo;, click the link that says &amp;ldquo;The conversation continues here&amp;rdquo; to get to the new room.</description>

      <description>The team developing the Riot app for Matrix regularly make a beta version with new features, improvements, and fixes available as a web app1 at https://riot.im/develop
Just login there with your usual Matrix username and password. If you have a tzchat.org account (or any non-matrix.org account) you should use your full Matrix username2 as username, something like @myusername:tzchat.org.
Once logged in, open up user settings (click your name at upper left and then choose Settings), click the Labs tab, and select beta features to enable by moving their control slider to green status.</description>

      <title>TzChat Matrix/Riot FAQ</title>
      <link>https://staging.tzchat.org/pages/tzchat-faq/</link>

      <description>Can I just move my existing matrix.org account to tzchat.org? No, sorry. The Matrix protocol does not currently provide portable accounts. Instead, each account is tied to the &amp;ldquo;homeserver&amp;rdquo; (so called) used to access the Matrix federation. In this respect a matrix account is similar to an email account in that it&amp;rsquo;s tied to the particular domain of the account. For most Tezos people already using Matrix their homeserver is matrix.</description>

      <title>TzChat.org goes live</title>

      <description>The Riot/Matrix services for tzchat.org accounts are now available for friendly users. The services are still being configured and tuned and so there may be rough edges, but tzchat.org accounts created now should remain indefinitely.
One quirk is that the entry pages refer to &amp;ldquo;tezos.modular.im&amp;rdquo; rather that &amp;ldquo;tzchat.org&amp;rdquo;. Our service is hosted by modular.im and tezos.modular.im is the actual &amp;ldquo;homeserver&amp;rdquo; host for tzchat.org accounts. We are working to change the pages to hide that internal name.</description>

      <title>tzchat.org Riot/Matrix service</title>

      <description>Thanks to a grant from the Tezos Foundation the Tezos community has a Riot (Matrix) server at tzchat.org of its own. Riot accounts homed on that server are likely to have faster response times compared to the overloaded servers1 for matrix.org accounts.
To register a new account at tzchat.org, visit the entry page and use Create Account. Providing an email address there will allow you to reset your password later, but that&amp;rsquo;s optional.</description>
